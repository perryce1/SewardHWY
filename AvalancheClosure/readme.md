# Route from Seward to Anchorage along the Seward HWY
## This map shows an avalanche closure along the Seward HWY, blocking travelers from their only route to the nearest city.
I am a student at App State and I created this map for a class project. I spent last summer working in Seward, Alaska and took several long drives north to Anchorage for groceries and medicine. There was a large avalanche along this highway on December 24, 2023. This stranded some travelers and cut off the only route that Seward residents can take to get to Anchorage, the nearest city and hospital. In this map, I highlight several businesses that stranded travelers might have been able to take shelter in while waiting for the Avalanche to clear.
